*About The Program*

This is a scorekeeping program designed to keep the scores of a variable amount of players. It is meant to be run alongside 
the actual game being physically played. 


*About the Game*

"Knock Knock" is a card game somewhat similar to gin rummy. Players start with 3 cards, and each successive round adds an additional card,
up to (and including) 13. 

1) To start, each player is dealt 3 cards by the dealer, after which the top card on the draw pile is turned over, forming the discard pile.
2) The player clockwise of the dealer goes first. They can either pick up the last card to be discarded, or draw a single card from the 
draw pile.
3) The player now has 4 cards, and must discard 1 card to return to the round's card count of 3.
4) A player wins a round when all the cards they hold are either part of:
-- a set of any suit (minimum of 3; ex: 3 Queens OR 3 sevens of different suits), OR
-- a run of the same suit (minimum of 3; ex: 4,5,6 of Hearts).
5) When a player can go out, they "knock" twice on the table before discarding. Every other player has one final turn.
6) After all other players have gone, the player that won the round reveals their set(s) and/or run(s).
7) Continuing clockwise, each player may "play" off of the winning hand, by adding to that player's set(s) and/or run(s). They may also put
down any set(s) or run(s) they have accumulated to avoid being caught with them (minimum of 3 cards in either a set or a run).
8) After all players have laid down what they can, scores are added up and accrued as follows:
-- 1-9 = 5 points 
-- 10-King = 10 points
-- Ace = 15 points (Don't get caught!)

*Notes/Tips*
- Additional decks of cards can be used depending on how many players are playing. Recommended players/decks:
  * 2-3 players - 1 deck
  * 4-6 players - 2 decks
  * 7-9 players - 3 decks
- Points are bad! After 13 rounds have been played, the player with the least score wins.
- Points are doubled for rounds 12 and 13.
- A wildcard can be used to represent any card in a conventional 52 card deck.
- For any given hand, that value of cards held is also considered a wildcard (i.e. 5's are wild on round 5, where
5 cards are held at any given time). 
- Joker's are also considered "wild." 

*Future Change Considerations*
- Add an upper limit on players (10?)
